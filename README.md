The device was created to demonstrate the capabilities of the ESP 32 microcontroller, which receives weather information for a selected city and displays it on an LCD screen. Five cities were chosen as demonstration examples: Moscow, Baku, Seattle, London, and Sydney. For the device to function correctly, you must configure network settings, such as your WiFi network name and password, and obtain a unique OpenWeatherMap API key and insert it into the program. Switching between cities is accomplished by pressing a mechanical button.
